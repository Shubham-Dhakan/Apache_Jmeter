* We will cover some important controllers which are used in Jmeter and why are used in Jmeter: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 

1) Simple Controller: 
--------------------> 
This controller is mostly like container which stores all the 
Sampler(requests)--> the HTTP'S and executes all the request at the time of execution
in sequence.

It can be used to execute group of specific request. 
For eg: registration > login > Form Submission

2) Test Fragment: 
---------------->
This contorller is same as Simple Controller (Alternative)
Which can be utilized by the <<< Module Contorller >>>

3) Module Controller:
-------------------->
Operation: This controller uses/utilizes << simple controller >> and its sampler(requests)
before sending some other sampler(requests)

For eg: We have 2 sample requests, one simple controller with 1 sample request

so Module controller will use simple controller and its 1 sample request before executing those 
2 sample requests in our thread group.

4) Include Controller:
----------------------->
Will execute the scripts which are already existing.

5) Radom Controller: 
-----------------------> 
For eg: we have 2 sampler(requests) 
So at the time of execution it will only execute one request randomly at a time of total requests.  

6) Random Ordder Controller: 
-----------------------------> 
It is like << simple Controller >> 
This controller will execute all the sampler(request) of total requests. 
But the order of execution will be random. 

7) Interleave Controller: 
------------------------------> 
This controller behaves similarly as Random Controller, 
executes one controller at a time.

But MAINLY it follows sequential order. 
In 1 loop it will execute first sampler (request)

In 2 loop it will execite second sampler (request)

8) Through Put Controller: 
------------------------------> 
Through this controller tester can divide load of on website by 
creating several << throughput controllers >> under one thread group.
